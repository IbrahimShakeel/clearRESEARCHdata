# clearRESEARCHdata
I know that you all NEED to clear your "research stuff" from your browser history every now and then because "reasons". This is an awkward stupefying simple code and shell script you can use to kill the data by tweeting a specific key word!. You could schedule a cron job to run the ruby code once every minute to make sure it catches your tweet with the magic word.

The code has been tested only on Google Chrome running in Fedora 22. I'd welcome pull requests to accommodate more browsers and operating systems.
