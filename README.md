# clearRESEARCHdata
I know that you all NEED to clear your "research stuff" from your browser history every now and then because "reasons". This is an awkward stupefying simple code and shell script you can use to kill the data by tweeting a specific key word!. You could schedule a cron job to run the ruby code once every minute to make sure it catches your tweet with the magic word.

<b>WARNING:</b> The shell script will nuke everything including your browser extensions. Make a backup before testing the code.

The code has been tested <b>only</b> on Google Chrome running in Fedora 22.
